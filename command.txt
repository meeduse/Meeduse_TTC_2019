* After generating the B specifications from an input model, you can run the 
ProB model-checker in order to find deadlocks, invariant violations, reachable 
states, counter examples of LTL formulas, etc. This gives a formal proof about 
the correctness of the transformation given an input model. A demonstration is 
given in video "model_checking.mov".

* In order to run ProB, you can use the following command inside the folder of 
the input model. Replace  {ProB_Home} by the folder where you extracted the 
prob zip file. 

{ProB_Home}/probcli -model_check -df -disable_time_out meeduse_tt2bddref.ref -noass -noinv -sptxt output.probstate -logxml log.xml

ProB can be downloaded from:
